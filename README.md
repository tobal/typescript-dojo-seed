This is a repository for you to use as a seed for coding dojos using typescript. For a quick overview of the syntax of typescript, look at the following link:

## Setting up the environment

You need to install typescript globally and the dependencies locally using npm

```
$> npm install -g typescript
$> npm install
```

For your convenience, you should use an editor with typescript support. My recommendation is sublime text, you can use the Typescript plugin with it:

For vim, check out these plugins:

## Running tests

You can compile your ts files and run your tests using the tests maketarget:

```$> make tests```
